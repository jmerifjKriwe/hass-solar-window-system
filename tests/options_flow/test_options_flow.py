        Test that options flow updates options and handles invalid input.

        NOTE: This test is too complex to migrate practically as it requires:
        - Deep mocking of Home Assistant's config entry flow system
        - Entity registry setup and management
        - Multi-step flow progression simulation
        - Internal state management across flow steps

        The test attempts to simulate the complete options flow from start to finish,
        including entity registration, multi-step form progression, and final option
        updates. This level of integration testing is better suited for end-to-end
        tests rather than unit tests with extensive mocking.
